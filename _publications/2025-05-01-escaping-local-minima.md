We introduce a hybrid navigation algorithm that switches between Artificial Potential Field (APF) and Wall-Following (WF) to overcome local minima in decentralized multi-robot systems.

### Highlights

- Fully decentralized, mapless, and communication-free
- Adaptive switching based on 2D LiDAR perception
- Learning-based switching model trained from human demonstration
