This paper proposes **Safe Interval RRT\***, a scalable algorithm for multi-robot path planning in continuous spaces.

### Highlights

- Supports up to 100 omnidirectional robots in simulation
- Integrated with NVIDIA Isaac Sim for realistic validation
- Compared against Graph Transformer-based MAPF baselines
