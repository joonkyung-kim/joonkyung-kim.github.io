<!-- 
Inspired by challenges in elevator navigation, this work uses deep reinforcement learning to enable robots to safely enter confined spaces.

### Highlights

- Designed reward functions for safe entry without blocking doors
- Trained in simulation and validated in real-world setups
- Demonstrated generalization to unseen elevator layouts
